Script to migrate mantis database to redmine
--
original script by Ulrich Kautz

--

modified by Philipp SchÃ¼le to allow to 
    - import categories / do not use the trackers as categories
    - use severity column to determine the tracker (feature/bug)
    - skip attachments because they might be  in the DB

config.txt
    - added 3 more config options:
        -> tracker_id_feature = 1   # to automatically assign issues with (mantis) severity "feature" to redmine tracker with id 1 
        -> tracker_id_bug = 2       # to automatically assign issues with other severity to redmine tracker with id 2
        -> attachments_in_db = 1    # skip attachments as they are saved in the mantis db

TODO
    - make it possible to switch between categories -> categories / categories -> tracker import (via config/cli param)
    - get attachment files from mantis db
