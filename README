Script to migrate mantis database to redmine
--
original script by Ulrich Kautz

--

modified by Philipp SchÃ¼le to allow to 
    - import categories / do not use the trackers as categories
    - use severity column to determine the tracker (feature/bug)
    - skip attachments because they might be  in the DB

TODO
    - make it possible to switch between categories -> categories / categories -> tracker import (via config/cli param)
